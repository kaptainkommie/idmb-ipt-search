# imdb-ipt-search
IMDb IPTorrents Search is a Chrome Extension that adds an IPTorrents Search Link
to IMDB title pages. It should be compatible with all recent versions of Chrome.
It was developed on and tested with version 49.0.2623.112. If you run into any 
compatibility issues please add them to the project's GitHub Issues page.

This Chrome Extension simply adds a link in the "Watch Now" bar on IMDb movie 
and TV show pages which, when clicked, opens search results from the
IPTorrents.com website. The purpose of this extension is simply to reduce the 
amount of typing and clicks required to search for a movie or TV show on 
IPTorrents after a user has visited its IMDb page.

**The only permissions required by this extension is access to 
http://www.imdb.com as well as access to storage, which is simply used to store
the extension's options. It collects absolutely NO PERSONAL INFORMATION.**

The source code is freely available under the GNU GPL v3 license. In essence it
is free to use, modify and redistribute so long as the source is made available
with it. The full license can be found at [LICENSE](LICENSE?raw=true).

## Options Menu
The extension does have some options that can be customized. These options allow
the user to specify which TV and movie categories they would like to be included
in their IPTorrents search. By default, all available categories are searched. 
In addition to the categories, the user may customize how the search results are
sorted. By default, they are sorted by newest torrent.

Users can now select which IPTorrents url they wish to use, all options use
HTTPS.
