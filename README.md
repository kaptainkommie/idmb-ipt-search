IMDb IPTorrents Search is a Chrome Extension that adds an IPTorrents Search Button to IMDB title pages. It should be compatible with all recent versions of Chrome. It was developed on and tested with version 47.0.2526.111. If you run into any compatibility issues please add them to issues.

This Chrome Extension simply adds a button next to the "Watchlist" button on IMDb movie and TV show pages which, when clicked, opens search results from the IPTorrents.com website. The purpose of this extension is simply to reduce the amount of typing and clicks required to search for a movie or TV show on IPTorrents after a user has visited its IMDb page.

**The only permissions required by this extension is access to http://www.imdb.com as well as access to storage, which is simply used to store the extension's options. It collects absolutely NO PERSONAL INFORMATION.**

## Options Menu
The extension does have some options that can be customized. These options allow the user to specify which TV and movie categories they would like to be included in their IPTorrents search. By default, all available categories are searched. In addition to the categories, the user may customize how the search results are sorted. By default, they are sorted by newest torrent.
